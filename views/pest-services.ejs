        <p>Let's face it. None of us want to have to deal with household pests. Rodents and insects are something we prefer to forego talking about.

          Unfortunately, once pests have gained a foothold in your house they are far more difficult to exterminate.</p>

        <p>The last thing any of wants is an extended stay by these unwanted "guests". We would agree that, if we saw our roof was going to leak at next rain fall, we'd do something about it. After all, it's easier to prevent the problem than it is to fix it afterwards plus all the extra damage.</p>

        <p>Have you ever seen <a href="/termite-damage">termite damage?</a>

          Those guys are hungry, hidden, quiet home wreckers.
